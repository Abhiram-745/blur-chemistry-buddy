  <p><strong>Forces and stresses</strong> describe the external loads and internal reactions that act on materials and structures when they are used.

    <li><strong>Compression:</strong> Pushing or squashing force that squeezes materials together. Example: Table legs, chair legs, or a brick wall. Makes materials shorter and thicker; can cause buckling or crushing.</li>
    <li><strong>Bending:</strong> A combination of compression and tension caused by a force acting at an angle. Example: A shelf bending under heavy books. The top side is in compression, bottom side in tension.</li>
    <li><strong>Shear:</strong> Forces act across a material in opposite directions but close together. Example: Scissors cutting paper, garden shears, rivets. Causes materials to slide and split along a plane.</li>
    <li><strong>Torsion:</strong> Twisting force that acts around an axis. Example: Bottle lid being opened, car drive shafts turning. Can cause spiralling stress or material failure under rotation.</li>
