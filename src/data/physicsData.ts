  <h3 class="subsection-heading">Subsection 1 â€“ Types of Waves</h3>
  
  <div class="definition-block">
    <h4>ðŸ”µ Definition</h4>
    <p>Waves transfer energy, not matter. The particles in the medium vibrate to pass energy along, but they do not move with the wave. There are two main types of waves:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transverse waves</li>
      <li>Longitudinal waves</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="key-facts-block">
    <h4>ðŸ§  Key Idea</h4>
    <p>In both types, the wave moves energy from one place to another â€” but the particle vibrations happen in different directions.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
  <h3 class="subsection-heading">Subsection 2 â€“ Transverse Waves</h3>
  
  <div class="definition-block">
    <h4>ðŸ”µ Definition</h4>
    <p>In a transverse wave, the vibrations of the particles are at right angles (âŠ¥) to the direction the wave travels.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="key-facts-block">
    <h4>ðŸ§  Key Features</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Particles move up and down as the wave moves side to side.</li>
      <li>Have crests (peaks) and troughs.</li>
      <li>Can travel through solids and on the surface of liquids, but not through gases.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="example-block">
    <h4>ðŸŸ¢ Example</h4>
    <p>Ripples on a water surface are transverse waves. The water particles move up and down, but the wave itself travels outward across the surface.</p>
    <table class="data-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Wave Feature</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Displacement</td>
          <td>Distance from rest position</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Wavelength</td>
          <td>Distance between consecutive crests</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Amplitude</td>
          <td>Maximum displacement from rest</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>

  <div class="exam-tip-block">
    <h4>ðŸ§  Key Point</h4>
    <p>Transverse waves show how energy moves through the water â€” the water itself does not travel.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
  <h3 class="subsection-heading">Subsection 3 â€“ Longitudinal Waves</h3>
  
  <div class="definition-block">
    <h4>ðŸ”µ Definition</h4>
    <p>In a longitudinal wave, the vibrations of the particles are parallel (âˆ¥) to the direction the wave travels.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="key-facts-block">
    <h4>ðŸ§  Key Features</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The wave has compressions (where particles are close together) and rarefactions (where they are spread apart).</li>
      <li>Can travel through solids, liquids, and gases, but not through a vacuum because they need particles to pass energy on.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="example-block">
    <h4>ðŸŸ¢ Example</h4>
    <p>Sound waves in air are longitudinal. The air particles vibrate backwards and forwards in the same direction the sound travels.</p>
    <p><strong>Wave structure:</strong> compression â†’ rarefaction â†’ compression (wavelength is distance between compressions)</p>
  </div>

  <div class="exam-tip-block">
    <h4>ðŸ§  Key Point</h4>
    <p>Even though the sound wave travels across a room, the air itself doesn't move â€” only the vibration (energy) moves through the air.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
  <h3 class="subsection-heading">Subsection 4 â€“ Evidence That Waves Transfer Energy, Not Matter</h3>
  
  <div class="example-block">
    <h4>ðŸŸ¢ Observation 1 â€“ Ripples on Water</h4>
    <p>A small object (like a floating leaf or toy duck) on a pond bobs up and down as the waves pass but does not move across the pond. This shows that the wave moves, but the water stays in place.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="example-block">
    <h4>ðŸŸ¢ Observation 2 â€“ Sound Waves in Air</h4>
    <p>When sound travels, air particles vibrate back and forth. They pass on energy to neighbouring particles, but each particle only moves a small distance around its resting position. This shows that the air doesn't travel, only the sound energy does.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="key-facts-block">
    <h4>ðŸ§  Key Idea</h4>
    <p>Both transverse and longitudinal waves transfer energy, not matter. The medium (water or air) returns to its original position after the wave passes.</p>
  </div>
